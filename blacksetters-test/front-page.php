		<h2>What We Do</h2>
		<p>The Black Settlers of Alberta and Saskatchewan Historical Society (BSAS) research, compile, coordinate and centralize the history of Black Settlers in Alberta and Saskatchewan over the last century. All early Black Settlers and pioneers are dead and buried nowâ€¦ buried with them are their wonderful stories and rich histories.</p>
